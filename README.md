# GymTrack
COMP2084-F2022-ASP.NET-ASSIGNMENTS

In this web application I created a gym tracker so it is possible to keep the record of how many reps, sets and the weight that you are using for each exercise. Here it is possible to create your own category of exercises, your own exercise or variation, and it will end up creating a gym routine.
